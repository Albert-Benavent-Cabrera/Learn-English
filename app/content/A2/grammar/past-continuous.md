# Past Continuous

We use the **Past Continuous** to talk about actions that were **in progress** at a specific time in the past.

## Structure

It is formed using the verb **to be** in the past (_was/were_) + the verb ending in **-ing**.

| Subject       | Auxiliary (To Be) | Main Verb (+ing) | Example                              |
| :------------ | :---------------- | :--------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **I**         | was               | working          | I **was working** at 9 PM.           |
| **You**       | were              | sleeping         | You **were sleeping** when I called. |
| **He/She/It** | was               | eating           | She **was eating** dinner.           |
| **We**        | were              | watching         | We **were watching** TV.             |
| **They**      | were              | playing          | They **were playing** football.      |

## When to use it?

### 1. Action in progress at a specific time

- _At 8 o'clock yesterday, I **was waiting** for the bus._ (The action started before 8 and continued after).

### 2. Interrupted Action (Past Simple vs Past Continuous)

We often use the **Past Continuous** together with the **Past Simple**.

- The **Past Continuous** describes the "long" action (background).
- The **Past Simple** describes the "short" action that interrupts it.

**Examples:**

- I **was walking** down the street when I **saw** him.
    - _(Long action: walking / Short action: saw)_
- She **was cooking** when the phone **rang**.
- We **were studying** when the lights **went out**.

### 3. Two actions happening at the same time

- I **was reading** while he **was cooking**.

## Negative and Question Forms

### Negative

Add **not** after _was/were_.

- I **was not** (wasn't) sleeping.
- They **were not** (weren't) listening.

### Questions

Invert the subject and auxiliary verb.

- **Were** you **working** yesterday?
- **Was** she **studying**?

## Practice

Choose the correct form:

1.  Yesterday at 6 PM, I (work) \_\_\_\_\_\_ on my project.
2.  I (sleep) \_\_\_\_\_\_ when you called me.
3.  They (not / watch) \_\_\_\_\_\_ TV.
