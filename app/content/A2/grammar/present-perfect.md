# Present Perfect

The **Present Perfect** connects the past with the present. It describes an action that happened at an unspecified time in the past or that started in the past and continues to the present.

## Structure

**Subject + Have / Has + Past Participle**

| Subject                 | Auxiliary | Past Participle        |
| :---------------------- | :-------- | :--------------------- |
| **I / You / We / They** | have      | eaten / gone / visited |
| **He / She / It**       | has       | eaten / gone / visited |

**Note**: Regular past participles end in **-ed** (worked, played). Irregular ones must be memorized (eaten, seen, gone).

## When to use it?

### 1. Life Experiences (Unspecified Time)

We talk about things we have done in our lives, without saying _when_.

- I **have been** to Paris. (In my life, sometime).
- She **has seen** that movie three times.
- **Have** you ever **eaten** sushi?

_Contrast with Past Simple (Specific Time):_

- _I went to Paris **in 2018**._ (Past Simple - we know when).

### 2. Recent Actions with 'Just'

- I **have just finished** my homework. (Moments ago).
- He **has just arrived**.

### 3. Changes over time

- I **have bought** a new car. (I have it now).
- She **has lost** her keys. (She doesn't have them now).

## Key Words

- **Ever**: Used in questions.
    - _Have you **ever** been to London?_
- **Never**: Used in negative statements.
    - _I have **never** flown in a helicopter._
- **Yet**: Used in negative sentences and questions (at the end).
    - _I haven't called him **yet**._
- **Already**: Used in positive sentences.
    - _I have **already** done it._
