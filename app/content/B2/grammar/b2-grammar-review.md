## 💡 Key Points

This video covers the essential grammar points for the B2 (Upper Intermediate) level:

### 1. Conditionals

- **Zero, First, Second, Third, and Mixed Conditionals.**
- Focus on the structure and when to use each (real vs. hypothetical, past vs. present).

### 2. Wishes / If Only

- Used to express regrets or desire for things to be different.
- **Wish + Past Simple** (present desire).
- **Wish + Past Perfect** (past regret).
- **Wish + Would** (annoying behavior).

### 3. Modal Verbs for Deduction

- **Must / Can't / Might / Could / May.**
- Used to express how certain we are about something in the present or past.

### 4. Causatives

- **Have / Get something done.**
- Used when someone else does something for us (e.g., "I had my hair cut").

### 5. Passive Voice

- Focusing on the action rather than the doer.
- Structure: **Subject + be + past participle.**

### 6. ING / TO Expressions

- Verb patterns (gerunds vs. infinitives).
- Verbs that change meaning depending on whether they are followed by -ing or to- (e.g., remember, stop, try).

## 📝 Examples

- _If I had known, I would have told you._ (3rd Conditional)
    - **Spanish Translation:** Si lo hubiera sabido, te lo habría dicho.
- _I wish I worked closer to home._ (Present wish)
    - **Spanish Translation:** Desearía trabajar más cerca de casa.
- _He must have forgotten the keys._ (Past deduction)
    - **Spanish Translation:** Debe haber olvidado las llaves.
- _I'm getting my car repaired today._ (Causative)
    - **Spanish Translation:** Me están reparando el coche hoy / Voy a que me reparen el coche hoy.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- Confusing the auxiliary in 3rd conditional (If I _had_ seen... instead of _would have_).
- Forgetting the "be" verb in passive voice.
- Using "wish" with "will" instead of "would".
